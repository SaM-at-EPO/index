### Time tracking 
Short introduction into a timetracking system is used by SAM EPO employees and contractors
- For the purpose of timesheet generation and office time tracking we all will use http://epo.10time.info application where you already have an accounts. HINT. Check your mailbox for a mail from 10time.info
-	Every team member **each business day** must record number of working hours by entering number of effective hours spent on EPO tasks in the office manually of using a FF/Chrome plugin. HINT Search your mailbox for a mail with subject "10times automation"
- The “Description” field is used to specify breakdown of your working hours (arrive-depart time and break length). The format of breakdown is **“HH:mm HH:mm | HH.hh”**, where the first timestamp is arrival time, second is a departure time and decimal after the pipe is a length of a break. In order to avoid delays with payment orders, please make sure that the breakdown and total time spent during a day corresponds to each other. According to SAM working hours policy and Dutch law it’s required to have at least half hour break daily. Average working day should not be significantly different from 8 hours (7.5 hours is OK; 12 hours is NOT OK).
