- The “Description” field is used to specify breakdown of your working hours (arrive-depart time and break length). The format of breakdown is **“HH:mm HH:mm | HH.hh”**, where the first timestamp is arrival time, second is a departure time and decimal after the pipe is a length of a break. In order to avoid delays with payment orders, please make sure that the breakdown and total time spent during a day corresponds to each other. According to SAM working hours policy and Dutch law it’s required to have at least half hour break daily. Average working day should not be significantly different from 8 hours (7.5 hours is OK; 12 hours is NOT OK).
